### Current
The current for this circuit is 3.32 mA
### Resistance
The formula for this would be 5/0.00332 which equals about 1500 ohms
This would mean that the LED has about 506 ohms of resistance
### Voltage Drop
When I did the voltage drop the resistance did not stay the same
This might've happened because it is a Non-Ohmic resistor
### Differtent LED
I changed the default LED to the old default LED which increased the resistance by about 61 ohms
I think this changed because after the LED grew old the material became less conductive
### Random Number
My random number was 8.73
In order to reach 8.73 mA with 5 Volts the resistance would have to be 573 ohms because 5/573 = 0.00873
